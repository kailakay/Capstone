## Purpose
As a professional chef coming into Data Science; my main goal for my career is to fuse my two passions in order to aid in tackling food accessbility and sustainability. My first step towards that journey continues with my Capstone project: researching the issue and developing an intimate understanding of the environment surrounding food sustainability. I've downloaded data that includes information global food production and dispersion. 

My goal with the project is to craft and hone into my own personal work flow; while also starting to get into the mind set that will allow me to succeed in moving on towards tackling deeper issues in this broad category of food sustainability. 

The original data sets can be found on Kaggle:

With production data ranging from 1961 through 2013; I found that China, India, and the USA have consistently been the top producers of the global food/feed supply. The two maps below show the side-by-side comparison of production in 1961 vs 2013. The darker the color, the higher the production amount.

While all three countries have continued to grow their production numbers; the United States has not managed to keep up with the growth in scale of China or India.
